# Internal-Temp-Sensor
This project is to measure the internal temperature of an ATMEGA328PB XMINI microcontroller. It measures the temperature and notifies the user (by flashing an LED) if it is above a certain degree. The user then has the option to turn off the LED.  

Refer to video at https://youtu.be/s9BsVu84x8A for a descriptive and demonstrative walk through of the project.
